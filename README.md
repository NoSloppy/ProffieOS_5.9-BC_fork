5.9 Plus by BC. Nov 2021  
Includes:  
WavLen  
OLED supports idle.bmp loop instead of constant battery meter  
OLED supports Aurebesh text font  
Matching preon/out  pstoff/in  
Hum always start after 200ms of ignition.  
Auto Spins blaster blocks.  
Low battery warning only once  
Wavs for talkie  
i2c bus sleep less  
Save some memory  
Added TrColorCycleX with replaced transitions colorcycle.h   
Latest manuals in /doc folder  
Updated motion file to support LGT Proffieboards  

Included is a template config file named 'BC_sample_config.h'containing most defines (commented out if not used),
blade detect layout, and a sample presets.  
Also there's an OLED folder inside /display containing a bunch of display files and goodies.  

Additionally, I decided to include my signature effects packs via aliases.  
-Replace all the layers in a style for clash, stab, blast, lockup, drag, lightning block, and melt,   
with ONE layer using one of the aliases listed in the sample config template ‘BC_sample_config.h’   
ie:  
`BC_effects_1,`    
would replace all those layers in a style for you with custom animations by me.   
Variations for different base color blades included ;) See sample preset for an example of this.  

I suggest using the Font Search Paths feature by setting up a 'common' font folder,  
and putting the Volume Menu wavs and Spoken Battery Level wavs in there.  
You'll need this for the future if you want to use Edit Mode anyway.  
More info here:  
https://github.com/profezzorn/ProffieOS/wiki/Sound-Font-Configuration#font-search-paths  

The Volume Menu and Spoken stuff can also be the downloadable versions from the OS6.x alpha release.  
I made 7 different languages, most with varieties of voices.  
They are basically "robotic, droid-ish" sort of sounding, but there's a mix of female and male.   
The point is, the spoken stuff (if #define USE_WAVS_FOR_TALKIE is enabled) will all match if you have a consistent voice.

*Disclaimer Note*   
The spoken battery level in the 5.9 version uses delay(), which is not the “best” way to accomplish things,  
and profezzorn wouldn’t approve it for the official version. That said, while maybe not ideal,  
I have had zero issues with it. Since nothing much is going on while the blade is off anyway, performance wise,  
only accent and crystal chamber  LEDs will pause for a moment while it speaks.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  


This has some of OS 6's features, but acheived in a preliminary way.  There's no:  
Edit mode,  
official method providing expanded ability to link effects (preon/out  pstoff/in matching).
It *does* include WavLen for auto timing blade effects to the wav files, but no WavNum nor ColorSelect,  
so no matching preon01 to a specific preon blade animation for example).  
OS6 brings a bunch of other things. JUST UPDATE TO OS 6!!
